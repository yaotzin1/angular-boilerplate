**pre-alpha version**

This is an experimental pre-alpha version of angular boilerplate which allow to work on angular 1.x using great [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) syntax and [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) tool.

Why we need it?
==

Because JavaScript syntax for non-JavaScript developers is awful and... really we need something better. _TypeScript_ offer a generic types, classes, prompting syntax and many, many other features. I want to write a code faster and better, but I do not like to remember about all my code, what I wrote in other parts of code, where do I have this function and how I named it. Especially when I working in the team, it is really frustrating when I need to analyze someone else code to check name of the method. If you write code in the editor which support _TypeScript_ it simply will show you all public method in given class.


How to install
==
